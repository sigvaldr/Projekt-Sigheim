# Projekt-Sigheim
An unclever portmanteau of "Sigvaldr" and "heim" (meaning "home"), Projekt Sigheim is a minecraft modpack
designed to invoke a feeling of home and ease. It is, in other words, a Quality-of-Life (QoL) modpack,
filled with mods to help you and make your game run better, no matter which version you're on, we have plenty!
